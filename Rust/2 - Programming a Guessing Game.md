This chapter is going to work with a hands-on project to learn more about Rust. It'll introduce a lot of important concepts such as `let`, `match`, `methods`, `associated functions`, and more.

It'll be a guessing game, where a number is randomly generated, and then a user has to guess what the number is.

### Setting up a new project
To set up a new project, go to projects and make a new project with Cargo

```Rust
$ cargo new guessing_game
$ cd guessing_game
```

`cargo new` takes the name of a project as the first argument, and creates a new Cargo directory for it.

### Processing a Guess
The first part of this program is going to be asking a user for input and storing a guess, which looks like this :

```Rust
// main.rs

use std::io;

fn main(){
	println!("Guess the number!");

	println!("Please input your guess!");

	let mut guess = String::new();

	io::stdin()
		.read_line(&mut guess)
		.expect("Failed to read line");

	println!("You guessed: {guess}")
}
```

To start off, we have the line

```Rust
use std::io;
```

This indicates that we are going to be importing and using the standard Rust library.

Next is the line

```Rust
fn main()
```

The `fn` indicates that this is a function, the rest is pretty standard.

After that we have

```Rust
println!("Guess the number!");

println!("Please input your guess.");
```

Which looks familiar, but note the `!` at the end of the line. This indicates that we are actually using a `macro` instead of a function, which we'll get into later, but is important to know for now. Next we have 

```Rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

So we need to talk about `variables`.

### Storing Values with Variables
We can create a variable by using the `let` keyword.

```Rust
let x = 5;
```

Variables are *immutable* by default in Rust, meaning their values cannot be altered.

If we tried to alter the variables value, we would get this error. For example, this code

```Rust
fn main(){
	let x = 5;
	x += 5;
}
```

Would give this error.

```Rust
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:3:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     x += 1;
  |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

This error tells us that we are trying to assign a value to an immutable variable that has already been assigned.

In order to actually be able to change the data's value, we use the `mut` keyword.

```Rust
let mut x = 5;
```

With this, we can now mutate the data in the variable freely

```Rust
// main.rs

fn main(){
	let mut x = 5;
	println!("{x}");
	x += 1;
	println!("{x}");
}
```

This will compile fine.

Knowing this, we now know what the next line of code does.

```Rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

It creates a `guess` variable of type `String` that is mutable.

### Receiving User Input
Our next piece of code looks like this

```Rust
io::stdin()
	.read_line(&mut guess)
```

This calls the `read_line` method to get user input. We pass the `&mut guess` as a parameter to be the variable we want to store our gathered user input in.

The `&` shows that this is a reference, which is immutable by default, so we write `&mut guess` instead of `&guess`.

### Handling Potential Failure with the Result Type
Following this line of code, we have

```Rust
.expect("Failed to read line");
```

When we read something with `read_line`, it returns a `Result` value, which is an enum with two types: `Ok` and `Err`. Like other value types, `Result` has methods defined in it, one of which is `expect`. If the `read_line` method returns an `Err`, `Expect` lets us handle errors that come up.

### Printing Values with `println!` Placeholders
When we want to print the value of a variable, we use `{}` in the print statement

```Rust
println!("You guessed: {guess}");
```

This `{}` will read the value of a given variable and print it

```Rust
// main.rs

fn main() {
	let x = 5;
	let y = 10;
	
	println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);
}
```

This code would print `x = 5 and y = 10`.

### Testing the First Part
We can test the first part of the game with

```Rust
$ cargo run
```

Which will build and run the project.

### Generating a Secret Number
Next, we'll work on generating a random number. For this we'll use the `rand` crate and generate a number between `1` and `100`.

To add our random functionality, we are going to have to import a Crate. To do this, we go to the `Cargo.toml` file and add this under the `[Dependencies]` header

```Rust
// Cargo.toml

[Dependencies]
rand = "0.8.3"
```

This will import the `rand` crate with a version of `0.8.3`.

Cargo stores all crates in a registry, which tracks all versions of crates.

Once we've imported the crate, we can use the `rand::thread_rng()` function of random with a `gen_range` method to generate a number between `1` and `100`.

```Rust
let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
```

### Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number
Now that we have user input and a number, we can compare them.

```Rust
// main.rs

use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main(){
	// -- Snippit --

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number){
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

The `Ordering` type is another enum that has three variants : `Less`, `Greater`, and `Equal`. And after that we have the `cmp` method, which compares two values, taking a reference to what we want to compare with. It then returns an `Ordering` enum with the result.

The `match` method compares two values, in this case it's `guess` and `secret_number`. 

A `match` expression is made up of `arms`. An `arm` is a pattern to match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to `match` fits that arm's pattern.

Here's an example of the `match` expression.

If a user has guessed 50 and the number is 38, then when the code compares 50 to 38, `cmp` returns an `Ordering::Greater` enum value.

When the `match` expression is called, it takes the given values and begins working through each of the arms.

When we start working through the arms, it will run the first: `Ordering::Less` which does not match `Ordering::Greater`, so it moves on. It then gets to `Ordering::Greater`, which is the same, so it starts executing the code in the `Ordering::Greater` arm, printing "Too big!" to the screen.

Remember though that one of our numbers `guess` is defined as a String, and the other (secret_number) is defined as an integer, which means we have to convert the string before we compare them. To do this we use

```Rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

The first part of this is

```Rust
guess.trim().parse()
```

When we get a guess from a user, there is a `\n` added at the end of the string so we need to trim it with `.trim()`, so something like `5\n` will just Â be `5`. We need to tell Rust what value we want to convert to, so we use `let guess: u32`.

Then we have the ".parse()" method. The "parse" method lets us change a string into a different data type.

The `parse` method also only works on convertible numerical characters, and thus
has the potential to fail. Because of this, it also returns a `Result` value, 
which can be handled to execute error handling code. If `parse` can successfully
convert a number, it will return `Ok`, and if not, it will return `Err`.

### Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping
The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop, which we'll use to keep the game running.

```Rust
// --Other code--

println!("The secret number is: {secret_number");

loop { // Loop declaration
	println!("Please input your guess");

	// --Other code--

	match guess.cmp(&secret_number){
		Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
		Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
		Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
	}
} // Loop end
```

Here we've moved everything from the guess input into the loop function.

It will now continuously poll the user's input until specified otherwise.

### Quitting After a Correct Guess
Now we'll tell the game to quit when the user wins by using a `break` statement.

```Rust
// -- Other code --

match guess.cmp(&secret_number){
	Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
	Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
	Ordering::Equal => {
		println!("You win!");
	}
}
```

Adding the break line after the println! makes the program exit the loop.

### Handling Invalid Input
We'll also add some error handling for user input validation. Before, we've been crashing the game when the user inputs a non-number, but we don't want to completely crash the game every time this happens. Instead we want to handle the error and simply restore the game to a working point again.

To do this we'll change our `expect` code when we gather our guess from

```Rust
// -- Other code --

io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut guess)
.expect("Failed to read line");

let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

// -- Other code --
```

To

```Rust
// -- Other code --

io::stdin()
	.read_line(&mut guess)
	.expect("Failed to read line");

let guess:u32 = match guess.trim().parse(){
	Ok(num) => num,
	Err(_) => continue,
};

// -- Other code --
```

We switch from the `expect` call to a `match` expression to move from crashing
the error to handling the error. Since parse returns a Result enum, we can use
the match statement to process each of these possible results.

If the `Result` is `Ok`, then the number will be processed as normal. If the `Result`
is `Err`, then it will simply continue instead of crashing.

The `_` is a catchall value, which says to match all `Err` values, no matter what
information they have.

And with all of this, the guessing game is complete.
