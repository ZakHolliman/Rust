* Headers
* Blocks of runnable code to showcase ideas
* Runnable code has comments and runs correctly
* `<br>` put before each main section header
* Spelling


## Section Titles get h1 size

Code for piece in a program go like this

```Rust
fn main(){
	println!("Hello world!");
	let x = 5;
	println!("{x}");
}
```

If we've previously written some code in a block and are talking about a specific line, we just write the line like

```Rust
let x = 5;
```

If permissable, there should be a block of code that is runnable at the end of each section that demonstrates the concepts talked about in that section, along with its output.

* Put three `<br>` before each section title.

Code for programs that can be run if the entire thing is copy pasted into a terminal should include the name of the file such as `main.rs` at the top in a comment, along with a comment explaining what it does, or what it is a demonstration of. There should always be an `output` block underneath these sections of code as well.

##### h5 file name
```Rust
// main.rs
// Prints "Hello world!" to the console.

fn main(){
	println!("Hello world!");
}
```

##### h5 Output
```
Hello world!
```
