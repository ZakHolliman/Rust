This chapter is going to look at projects that use multiple files.

The first pieces we'll look at are `Packages` and `Crates`.

## Crates
`Crates` in Rust can come in two forms: a `binary` crate or a `library` crate.

##### Binary Crates
`Binary Crates` are programs that you can `compile into an executable` and run. Each function must have a `main`.

##### Library Crates
`Library Crates` don't have `main` functions and `don't compile into executables`. They instead `define functionality to be shared` with multiple projects. An example of this is the `rand` crate, which provides functionality to generate random numbers. This crate on its own cannot do anything, and must instead be `imported` into a `Binary Crate`. These are usually what people are talking about when they say "Crate".

## Packages
A `Package` is a `collection of crates that provides a functionality`. Packages contain `Cargo.toml` files that describe how to build them. Packages can contain `as many Binary Crates as you want, but only one Library Crate`.

## Modules
Here is a general outline of how a `module` works

* Start from the crate root - When compiling a crate, the compiler `first looks in the crate root` (usually `src/lib.rs` or `main.rs`) for code to compile
* Declaring modules - The the crate root file, you can declare new modules with the `mod` keyword.
